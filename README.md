## Getting Started

### Requirements
```
NodeJS >= 9
MongoDB >= 3.4
TypeScript >= 2.8
yarn >= 1.5 (npm should work too)
Webpack >= 4 (only for UI modifications)
```


### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ekliptor/WolfBot
yarn install
```
You can use `--production` flag if you only want to run the bot and not make any code changes.


### Start trading
Rename the `configLocal-sample.ts` file in the project root directory to `configLocal.ts` and add at least `mongoUrl` (plus some exchange API keys if you want to trade).


After running TypeScript (automatically in your IDE or run the `tsc` command in the project root dir) you will see a file:
```
build/app.js
```
Use the `build` directory as the working directory and run:
```
node app.js --debug --config=Noop --trader=RealTimeTrader --noUpdate --noBrowser
```
The `config` parameter must be a JSON file from the `config` directory. For a list of all parameters look at the top of the `app.ts` file.


### Writing your own trading strategies
API docs coming during 1st week of June. Look into the `Strategies` folder for examples.


### Modifying the UI
In the project root directory, run:
```
webpack --progress --colors --watch
```
The UI uses a single persistent WebSocket connection. UI related code is in the following directories:
```
├ project root
├─── public <- all code shipped to the browser
├────── js <- all TypeScript code to be compiled with WebPack
├─── src
├────── WebSocket <- all server-side logic to push updates to the browser
├─── views <- all HTML templates
```
